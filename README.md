# DebtCollector

Application to control debtors and their debts.

I was not in the role of a collector, but this is how I imagine their debt logs.

The application is comical, in some places there is dark humor, somewhere it was necessary to make the jokes flatter, otherwise the application would have been blocked. But in any case, this is a demo project for the portfolio and, in fact, it has not been completed to the end.

There are quite a lot of tools used in this app and some of them, in my opinion, are above my level today (junior).

Both structure and class are used to store data. To save and load data - userdefaults. The breakdown of the main data array by one of its properties is used, because of this it was necessary to write a special method for removing debtors from the list.

Quite interestingly demonstrated is the use of extension - for styling elements and controlling the currency of the application. A lot of work with styles, with dates, calculated properties and with a lot of basic views and modifiers.

The application demonstrates professional and versatile use of a large number of basic functions and elements of SwiftUI.
