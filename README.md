# DebtCollector

This is my very first application where I practiced this stuff:

Some basic UI Views, like:
NavigationView, Form, Section, Text, TextField, HStack, VStack, Spacer, Picker, DatePicker, ForEach.

Some modifiers, like:
.foregroundColor, .toolbar, .navigationTitle, .pickerStyle, .keyboardType, .focused.

I'm also used: computed properties, property wrappers like @State and @FocusState, different types of variables and constants (Int, Double, Bool, String), I'm used also ternary operator and "if" conditional operator, worked a little with "date", intervals and keyboard focus behavior with Done button inside. Also tried some formats for text views.
